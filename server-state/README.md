# Server State

Server state in a React application refers to data that originates from an external source, such as an API or a database, and needs to be fetched and synchronized with the client-side application. Unlike client state, which is managed locally within the browser (e.g., UI state, form inputs), server state is dynamic and can change independently on the backend.
Key characteristics and considerations of server state in React applications include: 

* **Data Origin**:     
    Server state is fetched from a remote server or API.

* **Asynchronous Nature**:     
    Fetching server state is an asynchronous operation, requiring handling of loading, success, and error states.

* **Synchronization**:       
    Server state needs to be kept in sync with the backend to reflect the latest data.

* **Caching**:     
    Caching mechanisms are often employed to improve performance and reduce unnecessary network requests.

* **Staleness Management**:      
    Server state can become "stale" if the data on the server changes, necessitating strategies for re-fetching or invalidating cached data.
