# A Comprehensive Guide to React Router (Version 7)

A guide on React Router. 

This resource describes the fundamental "why" to the practical "how" of building powerful and intuitive Single Page Applications (SPAs).

## What is a Single Page Application (SPA)?

Before we dive into React Router, let's understand the problem it solves. Traditional websites are made up of multiple HTML pages. When you click a link, your browser sends a request to the server, which then returns a new HTML page. This process involves a full page reload, which can feel slow and clunky.

A Single Page Application, on the other hand, loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user navigates. This provides a fast and seamless user experience, similar to a desktop application.

## Why Do We Need a Router?

If an SPA only has one HTML page, how do we handle navigation? How do we show different content for `/about` and `/contact`? This is where a **router** comes in.

A router is a library that synchronizes the UI with the URL. It allows us to:

  * **Create different "pages"** within a single React application.
  * **Navigate between these pages** without a full page reload.
  * **Manage the browser history**, so users can use the back and forward buttons.

For React, the most popular and powerful solution is **React Router**.

## Step 1: Getting Started with React Router v7

React Router v7 represents a significant evolution, focusing on streamlined data fetching and server-side rendering. While the core concepts remain similar to previous versions, the recommended installation and configuration have changed.

### Installation

First, you need to install the `react-router` library. Note that in version 7, the functionalities from `react-router-dom` are now consolidated into the `react-router` package.

```bash
npm install react-router
```

### The Core Components and Hooks

React Router v7 introduces a new, preferred way to set up your router using the `createBrowserRouter` function and the `RouterProvider` component.

  * `createBrowserRouter`: This function creates the router instance and is the recommended way to define your routes. It's especially powerful for applications with data-fetching needs.
  * `RouterProvider`: This component takes the router instance created by `createBrowserRouter` and makes it available to the rest of your application.
  * `Link`: The component used to create navigation links.
  * `Outlet`: A placeholder component used for nested routes.
  * `useParams()`: A hook to access dynamic URL parameters.
  * `useNavigate()`: A hook to perform programmatic navigation.

### Basic Routing Example

Let's build a simple navigation bar with a home, about, and contact page using the new v7 approach.

1.  **Create your components:**

    ```jsx
    // src/components/Home.jsx
    const Home = () => <h2>Home Page</h2>;
    export default Home;

    // src/components/About.jsx
    const About = () => <h2>About Page</h2>;
    export default About;

    // src/components/Contact.jsx
    const Contact = () => <h2>Contact Page</h2>;
    export default Contact;
    ```

2.  **Set up your router in `main.jsx` (or `index.js`):**

    ```jsx
    // src/main.jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
    import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet, Link } from 'react-router';
    import Home from './components/Home';
    import About from './components/About';
    import Contact from './components/Contact';

    const RootLayout = () => {
      return (
        <>
          <nav>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link> | <Link to="/about">About</Link> | <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
          </nav>
          <hr />
          <Outlet />
        </>
      );
    };

    const router = createBrowserRouter([
      {
        path: '/',
        element: <RootLayout />,
        children: [
          { index: true, element: <Home /> },
          { path: 'about', element: <About /> },
          { path: 'contact', element: <Contact /> },
        ],
      },
    ]);

    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <RouterProvider router={router} />
      </React.StrictMode>
    );
    ```

**Explanation:**

  * We use `createBrowserRouter` to define a single router instance.
  * We define a `RootLayout` component to provide a consistent navigation bar for our pages. It uses the `<Outlet>` component to render the child routes.
  * The route configuration is an array of objects.
  * The `path: '/'` route has `children`, which are the nested routes. The `index: true` property makes the `<Home />` component the default child for the `/` path.

## Step 2: Dynamic and Nested Routes

React Router v7 makes handling dynamic and nested routes even more intuitive.

### Dynamic Routes (URL Parameters)

URL parameters are defined with a colon (`:`) in the path. You still use the `useParams()` hook to access them.

1.  **Create a User Profile component:**

    ```jsx
    // src/components/User.jsx
    import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

    const User = () => {
      const { userId } = useParams();
      return <h2>User Profile for ID: {userId}</h2>;
    };

    export default User;
    ```

2.  **Add the dynamic route to your router configuration:**

    ```jsx
    // ... in router config
    const router = createBrowserRouter([
      {
        path: '/',
        element: <RootLayout />,
        children: [
          // ... existing routes
          { path: 'users/:userId', element: <User /> },
        ],
      },
    ]);
    ```

### Nested Routes

The nested route syntax is a core feature of the `createBrowserRouter` approach.

1.  **Create a parent component (`Dashboard.jsx`) with an `Outlet`:**

    ```jsx
    // src/components/Dashboard.jsx
    import { Outlet, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

    const Dashboard = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Dashboard</h2>
          <nav>
            <Link to="profile">Profile</Link> | <Link to="settings">Settings</Link>
          </nav>
          <hr />
          <Outlet /> {/* Renders the matching nested route's component here */}
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default Dashboard;
    ```

      * Notice how the `<Link>` `to` prop uses a relative path.

2.  **Define the nested routes in your router configuration:**

    ```jsx
    // ... in router config
    const router = createBrowserRouter([
      {
        path: '/',
        element: <RootLayout />,
        children: [
          // ... existing routes
          {
            path: 'dashboard',
            element: <Dashboard />,
            children: [
              { path: 'profile', element: <h3>Profile View</h3> },
              { path: 'settings', element: <h3>Settings View</h3> },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    ]);
    ```

-----

## Step 3: Protecting Routes

The concept of protecting routes remains the same, but the implementation integrates smoothly with the new router structure.

### Example of a Protected Route

1.  **Create a `ProtectedRoute` component:**

    ```jsx
    // src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx
    import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

    // In a real app, 'isLoggedIn' would come from a state management library or context
    const isLoggedIn = false; 

    const ProtectedRoute = ({ children }) => {
      if (!isLoggedIn) {
        return <Navigate to="/login" replace />;
      }

      return children;
    };

    export default ProtectedRoute;
    ```

2.  **Add the protected route to your router configuration:**

    ```jsx
    // ... in router config
    const router = createBrowserRouter([
      {
        path: '/',
        element: <RootLayout />,
        children: [
          // ... existing routes
          { path: 'login', element: <Login /> },
          {
            path: 'dashboard',
            element: (
              <ProtectedRoute>
                <Dashboard />
              </ProtectedRoute>
            ),
          },
        ],
      },
    ]);
    ```

## Step 4: Beyond the Basics with v7

### Data Loading with Loaders

This is one of the most powerful new features in v7. You can now define a `loader` function in your route configuration to fetch data *before* the component is rendered. This eliminates the "waterfall" effect of fetching data within `useEffect` and improves performance.

1.  **Create a component to display data:**

    ```jsx
    // src/components/UserData.jsx
    import { useLoaderData } from 'react-router-dom';

    const UserData = () => {
      const user = useLoaderData();
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>User Details</h2>
          <p>Name: {user.name}</p>
          <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default UserData;
    ```

2.  **Define a `loader` function in your router configuration:**

    ```jsx
    // ... in router config
    const router = createBrowserRouter([
      {
        path: '/',
        element: <RootLayout />,
        children: [
          // ... existing routes
          {
            path: 'users/:userId',
            element: <UserData />,
            loader: async ({ params }) => {
              const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${params.userId}`);
              const user = await res.json();
              return user;
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ]);
    ```

      * The `loader` function runs before the route's component is rendered.
      * The `useLoaderData()` hook in `UserData.jsx` gives you access to the data returned by the `loader`.

### Error Boundaries and Actions

  * **Error Boundaries**: You can now define an `errorElement` on a route, which will be rendered if a loader, action, or the element itself throws an error. This allows for granular error handling.
  * **Actions**: The `action` property in a route configuration is designed to handle data mutations, such as form submissions. This works with React Router's `Form` component to declaratively manage form data.
