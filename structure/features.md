# Feature Based Structure

The question of how to organize a large application is one of the most critical decisions you'll make. The simple `components/`, `pages/`, `hooks/` structure we discussed earlier is an excellent starting point, but it quickly becomes a liability as your application grows.

The problem with a traditional, "technical-based" folder structure is that it scatters a single feature's logic across multiple directories. To work on the "User Profile" feature, you might have to navigate to:

  * `pages/ProfilePage.tsx`
  * `components/ProfileHeader.tsx`
  * `components/EditProfileModal.tsx`
  * `hooks/useUserProfile.ts`
  * `services/profileApi.ts`

This "file-jumping" creates a high cognitive load and makes it difficult to maintain, refactor, or even delete a feature.

The solution favored by experienced developers is a **Feature-Based** or **Domain-Driven** architecture.

-----

### The Feature-Based Structure: A Scalable Approach

The core idea is simple: **Group files by feature, not by technical type.** All the code related to a single feature lives together in its own self-contained directory.

This approach transforms your application from a collection of technical files into a library of independent, modular features.

#### The Recommended Folder Structure

Let's refine our previous structure to adopt a feature-based approach.

```
src/
├── features/             # The heart of your application's logic
│   ├── Auth/             # A self-contained feature
│   │   ├── components/   # Components specific to the Auth feature
│   │   │   ├── LoginForm.tsx
│   │   │   └── SignUpForm.tsx
│   │   ├── hooks/        # Hooks specific to Auth
│   │   │   └── useAuth.ts
│   │   ├── pages/        # Pages specific to Auth
│   │   │   ├── LoginPage.tsx
│   │   │   └── RegistrationPage.tsx
│   │   ├── api.ts        # API logic for Auth
│   │   └── index.ts      # A barrel file to export everything
│   ├── UserProfile/      # The User Profile feature
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── ProfileCard.tsx
│   │   │   └── EditProfileModal.tsx
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   │   └── useUserProfile.ts
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   │   └── ProfilePage.tsx
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── ...other-features/
│
├── core/                 # Global, domain-agnostic utilities and components
│   ├── api/              # Global Axios client instance
│   ├── components/       # Truly reusable UI components (e.g., Button, Modal, Loader)
│   ├── hooks/            # Generic hooks (e.g., useDebounce, useLocalStorage)
│   └── utils/            # General utility functions (e.g., formatDate)
│
├── App.tsx               # Primary application component, houses the router
├── main.tsx              # Application entry point
├── styles.css
└── ...
```

#### Breakdown of the Structure

  * **`features/`:** This is the primary directory for your application's business logic. Each subdirectory within it represents a single, independent feature.
  * **`Auth/`, `UserProfile/`, etc.:** These are your feature folders. Everything inside `Auth/` is related to authentication and authorization. All the code for the `UserProfile` feature is in its own folder.
  * **Nested Structure:** Within a feature folder, you can still use subdirectories like `components/`, `hooks/`, and `pages/`. This keeps the feature's code organized.
  * **`index.ts` (Barrel File):** A common practice is to have an `index.ts` file in each feature directory. This file exports all the public components and hooks, simplifying imports in other parts of the application.
    ```typescript
    // src/features/UserProfile/index.ts
    export * from './pages/ProfilePage';
    export * from './components/EditProfileModal';
    export * from './hooks/useUserProfile';
    // etc.
    ```
    This allows you to import like this: `import { ProfilePage, useUserProfile } from '../features/UserProfile';`
  * **`core/`:** This is a crucial addition. It's the place for code that is **truly generic and reusable across the entire application**. If a component like a `Button` or a hook like `useDebounce` is used by multiple features, it belongs here.

#### Pros and Cons of This Approach

**Pros:**

  * **Exceptional Scalability:** The application becomes a collection of loosely coupled features. You can add new features without worrying about breaking others.
  * **High Maintainability:** If a feature needs to be refactored or removed, you simply navigate to its folder and everything you need is right there. Deleting a feature is as simple as deleting a single folder.
  * **Improved Collaboration:** Different teams or developers can be assigned to different feature folders with minimal risk of merge conflicts.
  * **Clear Ownership:** It's immediately obvious what code belongs to which part of the application.

**Cons:**

  * **Initial Overhead:** It requires more thought and structure at the beginning of a project. For a simple app with 3 pages, this might feel like overkill.
  * **Potential for Duplication:** Developers might be tempted to duplicate a component inside a feature folder instead of making a generic version and moving it to `core/components`. A strong code review process can prevent this.

### Senior Developer's Final Recommendation

For any professional project that you expect to grow beyond a few pages, the **Feature-Based Structure is the superior choice**. It's the standard for large-scale applications because it prioritizes scalability, maintainability, and team collaboration.

Adopt a hybrid model:

1.  **Start with the Feature-Based Structure** for all your core business logic.
2.  **Maintain a separate `core/` (or `shared/`) directory** for all truly generic, domain-agnostic code that is shared between features.

This strategy gives you the best of both worlds: a highly organized, scalable architecture for your unique business problems, and a central repository for reusable building blocks.
